1.Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
Yes. The repository size doubled its size after adding the big file. 

2. What is the reason for this problem?
Git maintains all the history of commit of each files/branches in .git/objects folder. Hence the size is grows. 
```
$ pwd
/c/Users/rramy/Desktop/demotest/.git/objects/77


$ ls -la
total 102436
drwxr-xr-x 1 rramy 197609         0 Jun 23 17:51 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 rramy 197609         0 Jun 23 18:02 ../

```

3.How do you remove something from Git history after it is pushed to the remote repository? Which commands would you use?
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file HEAD'

git push origin --force --all (remote origin master)

4. What are the consequences of the previous action?

I tried to work on this one and failed. Please provide me some reference for better understanding.
